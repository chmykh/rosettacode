# rosettacode
Various submissions to the RosettaCode programming chrestomathy site.

The site is called after the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone - an ancient stele with identical text written in Greek and Egyptian; the stele was a key to deciphering previously unknown Egyptian writing. The RosettaCode site presents a number of simple programming tasks implemented in multiple programming languages each, thus exposing languages properties.

## Chaos game

## Markov chain text generator
Very simple but efficient non-machine-learning, non-neural-network artificial text generator. One of few algorithms that generate good results on unprepared texts in Russian (try War and Peace).

## 15 puzzle
The popular (deterministic) 4x4 board game together with IDDFS solver, in the low-level language Forth

### Game

### Solver

### Combined game and solver
As both the interactive game and the automatic solver works on the same domain, it is natural the vocabulary is mostly overlaps, so it is reasonable to ship it together.

## Reverse words in a string
The tiny task where the Forth's implicit stack is a perfect fit.
